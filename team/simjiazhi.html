<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For our software engineering project, my team and I were tasked with transforming a working application (consisting of 10,000 lines of code) into a new product that tackles a real-world issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our team decided to address the problem with limited manpower in neighbourhood clinics. We realized that Doctors and their one or two
assistants usually have to handle a multitude of tasks when running their clinics. The lack of manpower can potentially affect
the quality of healthcare services provided negatively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, we have decided to create <strong>QuickDocs</strong>, an all-in-one applications to help doctors better manage their patient records, inventory, appointments, and conduct consultations more efficiently.
They can even generate useful financial statistics to make even more informed decisions for their businesses and improve their service quality
despite their limited manpower.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>I am in charge of developing the patient and consultation modules for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The patient module is responsible for registering, listing, updating and deleting patient records</p>

<li>
<p>The consultation module is responsible for conducting the consultation session and listing of past consultation records
belonging to each patient.</p>

<p>As consultation is a crucial aspect of a clinic&#8217;s operation, it will be the main feature showcased in this document.
The consultation process not only expedite an actual clinical operation, it is also the most integrated feature i have developed in QuickDocs.</p>

<p><strong>Created the consultation process of QuickDocs</strong></p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Doctors can record the patient symptoms and prescribe drugs to patients using one-shot commands on a single interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why is it needed:</strong> Doctors no longer need to navigate through multiple menus to perform these actions. Recording of symptoms and prescribing
medicine can be done with minimal keystrokes. This will help to expedite the consultation process, and the doctor can tend to other patients more quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How is it convenient:</strong> The diagnosis and prescription synergizes with the command history. Doctors can
simply navigate to the command previously entered, make changes before re-entering the diagnosis or prescription command to rectify errors or make changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> The prescription command is integrated with the medicine inventory. If the clinic have insufficient amount of medicine to support the prescriptions, the
doctor can be alerted and the incomplete prescription can be prevented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who / what to acknowledge:</strong> My inspiration for the replacement style of the diagnosis and prescription editing is drawn from the original <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4"><strong>AddressBook Level 4</strong></a>'s edit command.
It uses this mechanism to provide a more efficient way to make changes to the person&#8217;s particulars.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In a neighbourhood clinic setting, doctors usually tend to only one patient at a time. This is why QuickDocs only allow a single
ongoing session in the consultation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Singapore, every person is given a unique NRIC / FIN number regardless of their citizenship statuses. As such the NRIC is used to
search for the patient records to start the consultation session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prescription and diagnosis commands are made to override their previous states to ease the modification of consultation data.
Doctors can simply use the command history to navigate to the previous command entered, make the changes and then execute the command. This
allow them to simply add a few words to change consultation data rather than re-entering the entire command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescription can actually be added before the diagnosis is recorded. The doctor could be expecting a patient for regular checkup and prepare the
prescription before the patient enters the room. If the condition remains the same as before, the doctor can simply enter the diagnosis to complete the
consultation session, cutting down the time spent on the consultation session.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some of the considerations taken before the decision was made:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Since QuickDocs aim to provide a single interface for doctors to perform clinical operations more efficiently, the consultation
process will require one shot commands to fulfill the efficiency requirement of the overall product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is highly possible for doctors to make mistakes with the one-shot commands, especially when there are so many parameters involved
in a single command. Therefore the implementation must provide a convenient form of error recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There could be interleaving operations between the modules, such as viewing past consultation records or
checking medicine inventory in the midst of the consultation. The implementation must be flexible enough
to allow cross module commands during a consultation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The selected option features lengthier one-shot commands and this could lead to doctors making mistakes more easily.
However, doctors can recover from erroneous commands very quickly by making use of the command history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While a consultation session is ongoing, doctors can still perform operations beyond the consultation module as well, and not just be
restricted to diagnosing the patient or prescribing medicine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the selected option guarantees the flexibility and efficiency QuickDocs aim to deliver for doctors in neighbourhood clinics,
it is currently implemented to help doctors conduct their consultation sessions much more smoothly.</p>
