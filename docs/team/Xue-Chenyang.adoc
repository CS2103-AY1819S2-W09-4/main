I am **Xue Chenyang**, a Computer Science undergraduate student form NUS School of Computing. This project portfolio page describes my contribution in my school project: QuickDocs in module CS2103T.

== PROJECT: QuickDocs

== What is QuickDocs?

QuickDocs is an one-user all in one clinic management application developed by my team consisting of 4 students. +

My team was assigned to transform an existing application (of around 10,000 lines of code) to a new application that has real-world applications. +

My team decided to address the problem private clinics in Singapore are facing conflicts between limited manpower and the enormous amount of trivial but complicated management chores to handle. +

In QuickDocs, doctors can have greater control in facilitating patient consultations, organizing appointments, and monitoring financial and inventory records in private clinics.

== Summary of my contributions

My role in this project is to design and implement the medicine management module. The design of this module includes the data structure of medicine storage and the various commands essential to medicine management. +

The following is a list of notation used in this document and their respective meaning. +

[WARNING]
This is a highlight. Ideas and explanation that I want to draw your attention to will be written here.

[TIP]
This is a tip. Useful information pertaining to the features will be written here.

[NOTE]

=== Major Enhancements

|===
|_This sections illustrates my major contributions in this project, especially regarding to design and coding of medicine management module._
|===

* *Enhancement added:* I designed and implemented the medicine management module. +
** *What it does:* Medicine management is a key aspect of clinic management. My medicine management module allows the doctors to customize his/her medicine organization. It also supports a variety of commands to facilitate users in clinic management. +
** *Why is it needed:* With QuickDocs, doctors no longer need to go through tons of paperwork or sheets and sheets of Excel files to keep track of his medicine storage. All additions, modifications, prescriptions and organizations of medicines could be done on one single interface so that QuickDocs provides its users with the most convenience possible in managing their clinics. +
** *Highlights:* The medicine module is designed is in a directory format,  which supports quick search of medicines and mass operation of medicines without the need to type in lengthy commands. This will be explained further in details in
//Todo: add link
** *Who / what to acknowledge:* My inspiration for organizing medicines in a directory format is adapted from the folder system in most of the common Operating systems such as Windows.
