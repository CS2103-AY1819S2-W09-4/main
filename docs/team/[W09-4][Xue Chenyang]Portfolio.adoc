== PROJECT QuickDocs

== What is QuickDocs?

I am **Xue Chenyang**, a student form NUS School of Computing. QuickDocs is an one-user all in one clinic management application developed by my team consisting of 4 students. My team was assigned to transform an existing application (of around 10,000 lines of code) to a new application that has real-world applications. +

My team decided to address the problem that trivial but complicated management chores independent clinics in Singapore have too limited manpower to manage QuickDocs
