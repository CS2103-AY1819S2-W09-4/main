Hello! I am Aaron, an undergraduate studying Computer Science in the National University of Singapore. This is my
portfolio that documents the various contributions I have made to a Software Engineering project that my team have
embarked on, QuickDocs.

== What is QuickDocs?
QuickDocs is a desktop application that provides doctors with greater control in running their family clinics.
It assists them in their daily tasks such as facilitating patient consultations, managing medicine inventory,
scheduling appointments, keeping track of reminders and monitoring financial statistics.

These features can be summarized into four main modules:

* Patients and Consultations module
* Medicine inventory module
* Appointments and Reminders module
* Administration and Statistics module

QuickDocs has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) however most of the user interaction takes place via a Command
Line Interface (CLI). It was built in Java and JavaFX and was morphed from an existing Address Book application.

== Notation
Here are some of the notations that will be used in this portfolio:

* Text in `grey background` indicates either written code or user input.

[TIP]
This is a tip, to inform you of useful information.

[NOTE]
This is a note, to provide you with any additional information about a feature.

== Summary of contributions
|===
This section provides you with a summary of both technical and non-technical contributions that I have made
throughout the development of QuickDocs.
|===

Out of the four main modules that comprises QuickDocs, I was in charge of developing the Appointments and Reminders
module.

==== Appointments
Doctors can schedule appointments with their patients and ensure that they are organised neatly, with no conflicting
timings with existing ones.

==== Reminders
Doctors will not forget about upcoming to-dos by recording them down on their reminder sidebar.

The following are the summarized features of the Appointments and Reminders module:

* `add`, `delete` and `list` commands for both Appointments and Reminders to register them into QuickDocs.
* Automatic generation of reminders for upcoming appointments or alerts to stock up for a particular medicine.
* The `freeapp` command that lists out all free timings available to book an appointment, given a search range of dates.
* Displaying reminders on the reminder sidebar of the User Interface (UI).

=== Major Enhancements

* *Creation of the `freeapp` command*
* *Code Contributed:* [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=simjiazhi[Functional code]]
** *What it does:* Doctors can list out all free appointment slots for a particular range of dates.
** *Why is it needed:* Before the doctor schedules an appointment with his/her patient, they must first agree on a
suitable date and time. Typically, the doctor has to look through his/her whole schedule of appointments and figure
out an appropriate timing from there. With `freeapp`, the doctor is only one command away from viewing all free
timings for a given range of dates. The doctor can then view the results with the patient and quickly come to an
agreement. QuickDocs does the thinking instead!
** *Highlights:* To make `freeapp` even more convenient, the user does not have to be bothered with the specific dates
to search. Instead, he/she only has to provide a single `DATE` and a `FORMAT`, which can either be `day`, `week`, or
`month`.

=== Minor Enhancements:
* *Creation of the reminder sidebar*
** Reminders are displayed on the sidebar to make it more obvious to the doctor, and by default only the reminders for
the current week will be displayed.
** Reminders are colour-coded:
*** [blue]#Blue#: Reminders for appointments.
*** [red]#Red#: Reminders to stock up on a medicine.
*** [yellow]#Beige#: Any other personal reminders.
** Clicking a reminder on the sidebar will display all its information on the main display.
* *Automatic generation of reminders*
** When an appointment is added, a reminder will automatically be created for this appointment to ensure that the
doctor does not forget about it in the future.
** When a medicine's quantity drops below its specified threshold, a reminder will automatically be created to alert
the doctor.

=== Other contributions:
* *Project Management:*
** Helped to manage the milestone goals and the issue tracker on QuickDocs' GitHub project page.

* *Designing QuickDoc's User Interface (UI):*
** At the start of the project, I assisted the team in designing the layout and structure of QuickDoc's UI
that is currently implemented.

* *Team Collaboration:*
** At the initial stages of the QuickDocs, the Storage mechanism was not yet implemented and we had to manually
execute commands to load QuickDocs with sample data for every new session. Hence I helped to create sample Patient,
Appointment, and Reminder data that were loaded at every QuickDocs launch -
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W09-4/main/pull/55/commits/99d3b8767dafcd254ee53a47764f7365d7fce199[Sample Data]
** Assisted the team in designing the Storage mechanism, allowing QuickDocs to save and read data from a json file.
** Moreover, I helped to write the test cases for the Storage component after it was implemented by a teammate -
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W09-4/main/pull/123/commits/4b332c1dfb308c1abd1612b7ca13a3635e4e69aa[JsonSerializableQuickDocsTest],

* *Documentation:*
** Documented the implementation of the Storage component in the Developer Guide.
** Provided formatting suggestions and implemented them for the User Guide and Developer Guide.

* *Community Involvement:*
** Reviewed and merged Pull Requests (PR) made by team members, providing non-trivial comments -
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W09-4/main/pull/105[#105]
** Tested another team's application, reporting bugs found and offering suggestions -

https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/pe-dry-run/issues/567[3]

* *Tools:*
** Assisted in setting up the continuous integration plugin TravisCI for the team's QuickDocs repository on GitHub.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|This section consists of my additions to QuickDoc's User Guide, showcasing my ability to write documentation targeted
to end users that might have limited technical knowledge. I will only be showcasing some commands relating to
Appointments, however the full User Guide can be found
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W09-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[here].

=== Appointment and Reminders
The appointment and reminder modules give you more control over your busy schedule, featuring commands such as adding, removing,
and searching appointments and reminders. There is also a command to list out all free appointment timings to help you choose
your appointment timings more wisely.

You will never forget about any appointments or tasks again! +

'''
[[addapp]]
==== Adding appointments: `addapp`
After a consultation session, you may want to schedule a follow-up appointment with your patient. You can use `addapp`
to create an appointment with an existing patient in QuickDocs to add to your schedule.

[TIP]
The `<<freeapp, freeapp>>` command may be useful for you to first list out all free appointment timings for a given range of dates
before choosing an appropriate appointment timing.

[NOTE]
To ensure that you do not forget about about any future appointments, QuickDocs will automatically create a reminder for
the added appointment. You may not notice this reminder as it will only appear on your reminder sidebar closer to the date
of the actual appointment (on the week of the appointment date)!

{sp} +
*Format:* `addapp r/NRIC d/DATE s/START e/END c/COMMENT` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `aa` +

[NOTE]
The format for a valid date is strictly YYYY-MM-DD (including the dashes) and a valid time is strictly HH:MM (including the colon).
If unsure, you can refer to the example below.

{sp} +
*Example and results:*

* `addapp r/S9534567B d/2019-07-23 s/16:00 e/17:00 c/Weekly checkup` +

This adds an appointment allocated to the patient with NRIC S6394980I, on 23rd July 2019, from 4pm to 5pm. You can
include any comments or notes you want to this appointment, which is 'Weekly checkup' in this case.

If the addition of the appointment was successful, QuickDocs will show the details of the added appointment on the
main display as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.The main display after adding an appointment
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_success.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

The addition of the appointment could have failed as there is a conflict in timing with another existing appointment.
QuickDocs will display a message in the input feedback box notifying you of this error, as demonstrated in the diagram below.

.Adding an appointment that has conflicting timing with an existing appointment
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_clash.png[width="600"]
{sp} +


Another reason for failing to add an appointment could be due to the appointment timing being outside of office hours
which is from 9am to 6pm. QuickDocs will alert you of this error, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Adding an appointment that is not within the office hours, from 9am to 6pm
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_officehour.png[width="600"]

'''
[[listapp]]
==== Listing appointments: `listapp`
You can list all past and future appointments that you have added using the `listapp` command. The appointments will be ordered and
listed, with the earliest appointment at the top and the latest at the bottom. You can filter the appointments
you want to see either by specifying a `FORMAT` and a `DATE`, or by specifying an existing patient's `NRIC`.

{sp} +
*Format:* `listapp f/FORMAT d/DATE` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `listapp r/NRIC` +
*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `la` +

[NOTE]
The valid keywords for `FORMAT` are only `day`, `week`, or `month`.

{sp} +
*Examples:*

* `listapp` +

By default, `listapp` will list all appointments scheduled in the current week if there are no keywords provided. +
{sp} +

* `listapp f/day d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all appointments scheduled on 23rd July 2019. +
{sp} +

* `listapp f/week d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all appointments scheduled on the given week of 23rd July 2019, which is from 22nd to 28th July. A week starts on a
Monday and ends on a Sunday. +
{sp} +

* `listapp f/month d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all appointments scheduled in the month of the given date, July 2019. +
{sp} +

* `listapp r/S9123456A` +

Lists all appointments allocated to the patient with NRIC S9123456A, if this patient is registered in QuickDocs. +
{sp} +

*Result:*

The filtered appointments will be ordered by time and listed on the main display of QuickDocs, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Listing appointments scheduled on the week of 23rd July 2019.
image::ug-app_rem/listapp_week.png[width="600"]

'''
[[deleteapp]]
==== Deleting appointments: `deleteapp`
If the patient would like to change the appointment date, or if there is a mistake in the appointment details, you can
delete the existing scheduled appointment with `deleteapp` and then create a new appointment.
Deletion of an appointment is final!

[NOTE]
QuickDocs will automatically delete the corresponding reminder created for the deleted appointment, if it still exists,
so you don't have to worry about any discrepancies with your sidebar!

{sp} +
*Format:* `deleteapp d/DATE s/START` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `da` +

[NOTE]
Since there cannot be any overlapping appointment timings, you are able to uniquely identify any appointment with
just the `DATE` and `START` time of the appointment.

{sp} +
*Example and results*:

* `deleteapp d/2019-07-23 s/16:00` +

This command will delete the appointment created on 23rd July 2019 with a start time of 4pm, if it exists. If successful,
QuickDocs will display the details of the deleted appointment on the main display, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Deleting an existing appointment in QuickDocs successfully
image::ug-app_rem/deleteapp_success.png[width="600"]
{sp} +

If the given appointment was not found, QuickDocs will display an error message on the input feedback display,
as demonstrated in the diagram below. Use the `<<listapp, listapp>>` command to find existing appointments for a given date!

.Deleting a non-existent appointment in QuickDocs
image::ug-app_rem/deleteapp_failure.png[width="600"]

'''
[[freeapp]]
==== List free appointment slots: `freeapp`
[[fa, freeapp]]
Unsure of what appointment timings are available in your schedule? Instead of using `<<listapp, listapp>>` to display all existing
appointments, use `freeapp` instead to display a more intuitive list of free appointment slots -
QuickDocs does the thinking for you!

The free appointment slots will be ordered and listed, with the earliest date at the top and the latest at the bottom.
You can filter the free slots you want to see by specifying a `FORMAT` and a `DATE`.

{sp} +
*Format:* `freeapp f/FORMAT d/DATE` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `fa` +

[NOTE]
Similar to `<<listapp, listapp>>`, the valid keywords for `FORMAT` are only `day`, `week`, or `month`.

{sp} +
*Examples:* +

* `freeapp` +

By default, `freeapp` will list all free appointment slots for the next month if there are no keywords provided. +
{sp} +

* `freeapp f/day d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all free appointment slots on 23rd July 2019. +
{sp} +

* `freeapp f/week d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all free appointment slots on the given week of 23rd July 2019, which is from 22nd to 28th July. A week starts on a
Monday and ends on a Sunday. +
{sp} +

* `freeapp f/month d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all free appointment slots in the month of the given date, July 2019. +
{sp} +

*Result:* +

The free appointment slots will be ordered by time and listed on the main display of QuickDocs, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Listing free appointment slots on the week of 23rd July 2019.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|This section includes my additions to QuickDoc's Developer Guide, showcasing my ability to write technical
documentation targeted for developers. I will be describing my implementation of the `freeapp` command, however I also
explained the technicalities of the Storage component and the Appointment and Reminder module, more of which can be
found
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W09-4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[here].
|===

==== Free appointment slots
Before deciding on an appointment timing, the user can execute the `freeapp` command to list out all the timings available for
a new appointment booking.

===== Command format
The `freeapp` command takes in two parameters: +

. `FORMAT`: can be `day`, `week`, or `month` +
. `DATE`: a valid date

This command can be roughly translated to: +
_"Search for free appointment slots on the `FORMAT` (day/month/week) of `DATE`."_

The `FreeAppCommandParser` class will parse these two parameters into two dates, `LocalDate start` and `LocalDate end`,
representing the start and end dates of the search range for free appointment slots. `FreeAppCommandParser` then
constructs a `FreeAppCommand` object with the `start` and `end` fields.

[NOTE]
If the user does not specify a `FORMAT` and `DATE`, `FORMAT` will default to `month` and `DATE` will default to the
current date, meaning that the current month's free appointment slots will be displayed.

===== Current Implementation
The search is facilitated by the `AppointmentManager` class which stores all created `Appointments` in an `ArrayList`.
`AppointmentManager` contains the method `listFreeSlots()` which firstly calls `AppointmentManager#getFreeSlots()`.
`getFreeSlots()` is the main method that implements the logic behind `freeapp`.

Given below are the steps taken when `listFreeSlots()` is called.

Step 1. The method `listFreeSlots()` takes in the two arguments, `start` and `end`, which have been mentioned previously.
Firstly, `listFreeSlots()` calls `getFreeSlots()`, providing it with the same two arguments, to retrieve the
free slots before it can parse them into a `String`.

.Given search range from start to end date
image::dg-appointment/freeapp1.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 2. In `getFreeSlots()`, we first retrieve the existing appointments that are within this given search range
by using the method `AppointmentManager#getAppointments()`.

.Retrieved appointments in the search range
image::dg-appointment/freeapp2.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 3. Next, we look at all the appointments that are present on the `start` date, as shown in the diagram below.
These appointments are sorted by date and time, with the earliest appointment on the left and the latest on the right.

.Selected appointments on start date
image::dg-appointment/freeapp3.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
[NOTE]
Since the appointments are already sorted, we do not need to search through the whole appointment list to
find appointments present on the `start` date. We can simply go through the list from the beginning
until we reach an appointment date that is not equals to `start`.

{sp} +
Step 4. We fill in each empty 'gap' between any two appointments by creating a `Slot` object.

Each `Slot` object represents a single time period on a single date. It has three attributes: +

* `LocalDate date` - the date of this time slot.
* `LocalTime start` - the start time of this time slot.
* `LocalTime end` - the end time of this time slot.

In this `freeapp` context, these slots created represents a time period without any scheduled appointments.

.Slots created to fill in empty time slots
image::dg-appointment/freeapp4.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
[NOTE]
Slots will only be created for timings during office hours (09:00 to 18:00). This is to prevent any possible
inconvenience caused if the user accidentally decides on a timing outside of office hours.
(Even though there will be an office hour constraint when the user eventually creates the appointment.)

{sp} +
Step 5. We repeat Steps 3 and 4, replacing the `start` date with the remaining dates until the `end` date.
All slots created will be added into an `ArrayList` of free slots, `freeSlots`.

.All empty time slots filled
image::dg-appointment/freeapp5.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 6. After all the slots are added, we return `freeSlots` to the caller function `listFreeSlots()`,
to generate a `String` that represents all the free slots to be appended onto the main display of the UI.

{sp} +

We can summarize the steps taken after the `freeapp` command is called in the Sequence Diagram below:

.Sequence diagram when `freeapp` is called
image::dg-appointment/freeapp_SD.png[width="800"]


===== Design Considerations
Listed below are some of the considerations we took when designing the `freeapp` command.

1. This feature was implemented for the convenience of the user in choosing a valid appointment slot with his/her patient.
It is more intuitive to decide on an appointment slot based on all the empty slots shown, rather than listing out
all existing appointments using `listapp` and then figuring out what timings are available from there.

2. We require the user to specify the search range by listing the `FORMAT` and `DATE` instead of the the `start` and
`end` dates directly, to make the command more user friendly. The user does not have to be bothered with the exact
range of dates to search, and can simply specify a rough date and be provided with information for the neighbouring
dates if the `FORMAT` given is `week` or `month`. Moreover, if the user wants to list all free slots for the whole
month, they do not have to check what the last date of the month is in order to specify the end date.

===== Alternatives Considered
Listed below are the methods considered to implement the `freeapp` command.

[cols="1,2a,1, 1", options="header"]
|===
|Alternative |Description |Pros | Cons
// row 1
|*Maintain a permanent list of free slots*
|Maintain a list of free slots for a pre-determined range (e.g. next three months) instead of creating a new list
every time `appfree` is called.
|It will be quicker to search for free slots as the list is already created. We simply need to filter the list
with the given search range and print out the resulting filtered slots.
|Tedious work needs to be done to maintain this permanent list of free slots, as it has to be modified whenever an
appointment is added or deleted.

Also, if the given search range is not within the range of this consistent list of free slots,
this list will still have to be created from scratch, defeating the purpose of maintaining this permanent list.
// row 2
|*Generate free slots only when required*

*(Chosen implementation)*
|We will only generate a list of free slots when the `freeapp` command is called. This list will be a one-time use
only and will not be stored in QuickDocs Storage.
|The user is given the flexibility to specify the range of dates to list the free slots, as this list is generated
on the spot, and is not limited to the dates of a pre-determined list.
|Since the generated list of free slots is not stored, extra work will be done in generating the same free slots
when the next `freeapp` is called, that has a range of dates which overlaps the previous `freeapp` dates.
|===

We decided to implement the second method, as it is more straightforward. Here are the reasons why: +

. The first implementation is actually just an extension of the chosen implementation as it still requires a way
to generate a list of free slots, either when QuickDocs is launched or when the user requests a search range outside
of the pre-determined list.
. The first implementation additionally requires more effort to maintain this permanent list whenever the
list of appointments is modified, which is not straightforward to implement. For example, we need a method to merge
two free slots when an appointment is deleted, and another method to split a free slot into two when an appointment
is added.
. The benefit of a permanent list of free slots is the quicker execution time of `freeapp`, which will typically
only be called a small number of times (around 10) a day, when the user books an appointment slot with his/her patient.
The total time saved on executing `freeapp` a small number of times is therefore negligible.
. QuickDocs already has plenty of data to be stored, such as appointments, consultations and medicine records.
The minimal benefits that a permanent list of free slots provide does not justify its additional storage cost.
