=== Patient Management
The Patient Management module features commands involving the registration, update, searching
and removal of patient records in QuickDocs.

Using just a few keystrokes, you can manage your patient records in a more organized and efficient manner.

'''

[[addpat, Add patient]]
==== Adding patient: `addpat`

You can register new patients and start storing their records in QuickDocs using the `addpat` command.

Patient details that can be stored include: name, NRIC, email, address, gender, date of birth, contact number.

[TIP]
You can add a tag to a patient to indicate his or her long term illnesses. You can add multiple tags to the patient to ease searching. +

{sp}+

*Format:* `addpat n/NAME r/NRIC e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS g/GENDER d/DATE OF BIRTH c/CONTACT  [t/tag]...` +
*Alias:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `ap`
[TIP]
The order of input does not matter as long as they are all captured. +

{sp}+
*Examples:*

* `addpat n/Gary Goh r/S7332803I g/M d/1973-04-01 a/20 Upper Changi Road c/92347654 e/ggoh@gmail.com t/highbloodpressure t/diabetes`

* `addpat n/Chan Mei Hua r/S8865281I d/1998-05-09 g/F c/92341221 a/2 Simei Street e/cmh@gmail.com`

{sp}+
*Result:*

After entering the `addpat` command, QuickDocs will show the details of the recently added patient on the
main display as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Main display after addpat command
image::ap_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

'''

[[editpat, Edit patient]]
==== Editing patient `editpat`

If you made a mistake when registering a patient, fret not! You can always make changes to the patient record with the `editpat` command. All the fields in the record can be edited, including the NRIC and tags.

[NOTE]
The tags entered during an edit patient command will override all the tags a patient record currently possess.

{sp} +
*Format:* `editpat NRIC [n/NAME] [a/Address] [r/NRIC] …` +
*Alias:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `ep` +

[NOTE]
you can view the prefixes for each of the fields at the <<addpat>> section. +

{sp} +
*Example:* +

* `editpat S7332803I n/Gary Doh e/gdoh@gmail.com`  +
This changes the email and name of the patient with NRIC: S7332803I to Gary Doh and gdoh@gmail.com respectively.

{sp} +
*Result:* +

After the `editpat` is performed, you can view the changes made to the patient record in the main display.

image::ep_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +
Since every citizen, permanent residents or foreigners in Singapore have their unique NRIC / FIN numbers, duplicate NRIC are not
allowed in QuickDocs.

When you edit a patient's NRIC/FIN and there is an existing patient with that NRIC, the current edit
will not be executed. You will also be notified of the detection of duplicated NRIC entries through the input feedback box,
in the manner shown in the following picture.

.Error message shown when QuickDocs detected a duplicate NRIC in the patient records
image::ep_conflict.png[width="600" align="center"]

'''

[[listpat, List patients]]
==== List patient details : `listpat`

To view a patient's detail, you can use the `listpat` command. You can search and filter patient records
by their names, NRIC and even their tags.

Suppose you are unsure of the patient's NRIC to start a command, you can always turn to `listpat` to help narrow down your search.
`listpat` can present all patient records that matches a search sequence you entered. For example, you can enter `r/S92` and the list command
will present all patient records with NRIC starting with S92.

You can then display a single patient's record by calling `listpat` with the full name or nric.

[NOTE]
Each patient record stored within QuickDocs have a record number, known as an *INDEX*. The
Index can also be used to narrow down patient searches to a single record.

{sp} +
*Format:* `listpat [PREFIX / KEYWORD] …` +
*Alias:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `lp` +

{sp} +
*Examples and results:*

* `listpat` +

If no keywords are entered, `listpat` will simply display the first 50 patients record stored.

.listpat command without any matching criteria
image::lp_noargs.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +

* `listpat n/P` +

Suppose you want to quickly find a patient record whose name starts with "P", you can use `listpat` along
with a sequence of characters to search for the specific patient record you are interested in.

.listing patients with matching name
image::lp_name_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +

* `listpat r/S92` +

You can narrow down your patient search by providing a NRIC sequence as well. For example,
in the figure below, you can retrieve all the patients whose NRIC starts with "S92".

{sp} +

.listing patients with matching NRIC
image::lp_nric_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +
After narrowing down your search, you will be able to use the specific NRIC number of a particular patient to view the in-depth
patient particulars.

.showing specific patient's record using the full NRIC
image::lp_nric_specific.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +

* `listpat t/diabetes` +

The tags you assigned to each patient can also be used to expedite the `listpat` command. For example, diabetic patients can be
listed using the `listpat` command along with "t/diabetes" value.

.listing patients by specific tag
image::lp_tag_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

{sp} +

* `listpat 5`

Did you notice that when QuickDocs display multiple patient records during filtering, each record starts with
a number? This is the index of the patient record, indicating the position the record is stored within QuickDoc's patient record storage.

.Patient record indexes
image::lp_indexes.png[width="600" align="center"]

=== Consultation Management

With QuickDocs, you no longer need to navigate to different menus just to record symptoms of the patient's illness, or assigning medicine to tackle
the patient's current condition.

Using the Consultation Management module, you can now handle the prescription and diagnosis stages of each consultation session
in one go.

''''

[[consult, Start consultation]]
==== Start consultation: `consult`

After a patient is registered, whenever he or she visits your clinic, you can start recording the diagnosis and medicine prescribed by starting a
consultation session on QuickDocs.

Consultation is started after the NRIC of the patient is provided, you can revisit the <<listpat>> section to help identify the NRIC
of specific patients +

{sp} +
*Format:* `consult r/NRIC` +
*Alias:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `c` +

{sp} +

After the consultation session has began, you can start recording the patient's ailments. The various symptoms the patients have can be recorded down,
along with the final assessment of the illness the patient is currently having.

To complete the diagnosis, the record must have one assessment and at least one symptom.

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

{sp}+
*Format:* `diagnose s/SYMPTOM [s/SYMPTOM] ... a/ASSESSMENT` +
*Alias:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `d` +

{sp}+
*Example:*

* `diagnose s/runny nose s/sore throat s/phlegmy cough a/influenza` +

The order of symptoms and assessment does not matter here. You record as many symptoms per diagnosis.

{sp} +
*Results:*

After entering the command, QuickDocs will show the symptoms and assessment recorded on the main display as demonstrated
in the following diagram.

.Result of the diagnose command
image::diagnose_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

For each medicine prescribed, the quantity must be specified. Like the <<diagnose>> command, you can always reenter the command to override
the current prescription should there be any errors made.

A minimum of one medicine and one quantity is required to record a prescription entry. The order of quantity entered corresponds to the order of the medicine entered. +

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

{sp} +
*Format:* `prescribe m/MEDICINE [m/MEDICINE] ... q/QUANTITY [q/QUANTITY]` +
*or:*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} `prescribe m/MEDICINE q/QUANTITY [m/MEDICINE] [q/QUANTITY] ...` +
