[[addpat, Add patient]]
==== Adding patient: `addpat`

You can register new patients and start storing their records in QuickDocs using the `addpat` command.

Patient details that can be stored include: name, NRIC, email, address, gender, date of birth, contact number.

[TIP]
You can add a tag to a patient to indicate his or her long term illnesses. You can add multiple tags to the patient to ease searching. +


*Format:* `addpat n/NAME r/NRIC e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS g/GENDER d/DATE OF BIRTH c/CONTACT  [t/tag]...` +
*Alias:* `ap`

[TIP]
The order of input does not matter as long as they are all captured. +

*Examples:*

* `addpat n/Gary Goh r/S7332803I g/M d/1973-04-01 a/20 Upper Changi Road c/92347654 e/ggoh@gmail.com t/highbloodpressure t/diabetes`
* `addpat n/Chan Mei Hua r/S8865281I d/1998-05-09 g/F c/92341221 a/2 Simei Street e/cmh@gmail.com`

*Results:*

image::pat/ap_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

After entering the command, you can view the added patient record on the display.

{nbsp} +

[[editpat, Edit patient]]
==== Editing patient `editpat`

If you made a mistake when registering a patient, fret not! You can always make changes to the patient record with the `editpat` command.

All the fields in the record can be edited, including the tags.

[NOTE]
The tags entered during an edit patient command will override all the tags a patient record currently possess.

*Alias:* `ep` +
*Format:* `editpat NRIC [n/NAME] [a/Address] [r/NRIC] …` +
you can view the prefixes for each of the fields at the `addpat` section.

*Example:* +

`editpat S7332803I n/Gary Doh e/gdoh@gmail.com`  +

image::pat/ep_before.png[width="600" align="center"]

This changes the email and name of the patient with NRIC: S7332803I to Gary Doh and gdoh@gmail.com respectively.

image::pat/ep_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

You will also be able to see the changes made to the patient record in the display after the command is entered.

image::pat/ep_conflict.png[width="600" align="center"]

Since every citizen, permanent residents or foreigners in Singapore have their unique NRIC / FIN numbers, duplicate NRIC are not
allowed in QuickDocs. When you edit a patient's NRIC/FIN, if there is an existing patient with that NRIC, the current edit
will not be executed. You will also be notified of the detection of duplicated NRIC entries through the input feedback box.

//[NOTE]
//The index (4, 21 is retrieved from the `plist` command. See: <<plist>>.

{nbsp} +

[[listpat, List patients]]
==== List patient details : `listpat`

To view a patient's detail, you can use the `listpat` command. You can search and filter patient records
by their names, NRIC and even their tags.

Suppose you are unsure of the patient's NRIC to start a command, you can always turn to `listpat` to help narrow down your search.
`listpat` can present all patient records that matches a search sequence you entered. For example, you can enter `r/S92` and the list command
will present all patient records with NRIC starting with S92.

You can then display a single patient's record by calling `listpat` with the full name or nric.

[NOTE]
Each patient record stored within QuickDocs have a record number, known as an *INDEX*. The
Index can also be used to narrow down patient searches to a single record.

*Format:* `plist [PREFIX / KEYWORD] …` +
*Alias:* `lp`

*Examples:*

`listpat` +

image::pat/lp_noargs.png[width="600" align="center"]

If no keywords are entered, `listpat` will simply display the first 50 patients record stored.

`listpat n/P` +

image::pat/lp_name_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

QuickDocs will list all patients whose name starts with P, this is very useful in searching for
the specific NRIC or index of a patient you are interested in.

`listpat r/S92` +

image::pat/lp_nric_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

You can now view all the patient detail entries whose nric starts with S92.

image::pat/lp_nric_specific.png[width="600" align="center"]

and then proceed to narrow down the search using the specific patient's nric.

`listpat t/diabetes` +

image::pat/lp_tag_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

By specifying the tag to be diabetes, you can list all diabetic patients.

`listpat 5`

image::pat/lp_indexes.png[width="600" align="center"]
