{nbsp} +

[[help,Help]]
=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

{nbsp} +

=== Patient Management
The Patient Management module features commands involving the registration, update, searching
and removal of patient records in QuickDocs.

Using just a few keystrokes, you can manage your patient records in a more organized and efficient manner.

{nbsp} +

[[addpat, Add patient]]
==== Adding patient: `addpat`

You can register new patients and start storing their records in QuickDocs using the `addpat` command.

Patient details that can be stored include: name, NRIC, email, address, gender, date of birth, contact number.

[TIP]
You can add a tag to a patient to indicate his or her long term illnesses. You can add multiple tags to the patient to ease searching. +

- - -

*Format:* `addpat n/NAME r/NRIC e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS g/GENDER d/DATE OF BIRTH c/CONTACT  [t/tag]...` +

*Alias:* `ap`

- - -

[TIP]
The order of input does not matter as long as they are all captured. +

*Examples:*

* `addpat n/Gary Goh r/S7332803I g/M d/1973-04-01 a/20 Upper Changi Road c/92347654 e/ggoh@gmail.com t/highbloodpressure t/diabetes`
* `addpat n/Chan Mei Hua r/S8865281I d/1998-05-09 g/F c/92341221 a/2 Simei Street e/cmh@gmail.com`

- - -

*Results:*

image::ap_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

After entering the command, you can view the added patient record on the display.

{nbsp} +

[[editpat, Edit patient]]
==== Editing patient `editpat`

If you made a mistake when registering a patient, fret not! You can always make changes to the patient record with the `editpat` command.

All the fields in the record can be edited, including the tags.

[NOTE]
The tags entered during an edit patient command will override all the tags a patient record currently possess.

- - -
*Format:* `editpat NRIC [n/NAME] [a/Address] [r/NRIC] …`
you can view the prefixes for each of the fields at the <<addpat>> section. +

*Alias:* `ep` +

- - -


*Example:* +

* `editpat S7332803I n/Gary Doh e/gdoh@gmail.com`  +

image::ep_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

This changes the email and name of the patient with NRIC: S7332803I to Gary Doh and gdoh@gmail.com respectively.

You will also be able to see the changes made to the patient record in the display after the command is entered.

image::ep_conflict.png[width="600" align="center"]

Since every citizen, permanent residents or foreigners in Singapore have their unique NRIC / FIN numbers, duplicate NRIC are not
allowed in QuickDocs.

When you edit a patient's NRIC/FIN and there is an existing patient with that NRIC, the current edit
will not be executed. You will also be notified of the detection of duplicated NRIC entries through the input feedback box.

//[NOTE]
//The index (4, 21 is retrieved from the `plist` command. See: <<plist>>.

{nbsp} +

[[listpat, List patients]]
==== List patient details : `listpat`

To view a patient's detail, you can use the `listpat` command. You can search and filter patient records
by their names, NRIC and even their tags.

Suppose you are unsure of the patient's NRIC to start a command, you can always turn to `listpat` to help narrow down your search.
`listpat` can present all patient records that matches a search sequence you entered. For example, you can enter `r/S92` and the list command
will present all patient records with NRIC starting with S92.

You can then display a single patient's record by calling `listpat` with the full name or nric.

[NOTE]
Each patient record stored within QuickDocs have a record number, known as an *INDEX*. The
Index can also be used to narrow down patient searches to a single record.

- - -

*Format:* `plist [PREFIX / KEYWORD] …` +

*Alias:* `lp` +

- - -

*Examples:*

* `listpat` +

image::lp_noargs.png[width="600" align="center"]

If no keywords are entered, `listpat` will simply display the first 50 patients record stored.

- - -

* `listpat n/P` +

image::lp_name_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

QuickDocs will list all patients whose name starts with P, this is very useful in searching for
the specific NRIC or index of a patient you are interested in.

- - -

* `listpat r/S92` +

image::lp_nric_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

You can now view all the patient detail entries whose nric starts with S92.

image::lp_nric_specific.png[width="600" align="center"]

and then proceed to narrow down the search using the specific patient's nric.

- - -

`listpat t/diabetes` +

image::lp_tag_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

By specifying the tag to be diabetes, you can list all diabetic patients.

- - -

`listpat 5`

image::lp_indexes.png[width="600" align="center"]

Did you notice that when QuickDocs display multiple patient records during filtering, each record starts with
a number? This is the index of the patient record.

image::lp_index.png[width="600" align="center"]

You can make use of the index number to view specific patient records as well.

{nbsp} +

[[deletepat, Delete patient]]
==== Deleting patient `deletepat`

When a patient is no longer visiting your clinic (i.e. moved residency), you can choose to remove their details from QuickDocs.

- - -
*Format:* `deletepat r/NRIC` +

*Alias:* `dp` +

- - -

*Example:* `deletepat r/S7338031I`

image::dp_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

This will delete the patient with the NRIC you have specified.

{nbsp} +

=== Consultation Management

With QuickDocs, you no longer need to navigate to different menus just to record symptoms of the patient's illness, or assigning medicine to tackle
the patient's current condition.

Using the Consultation Management module, you can now handle the prescription and diagnosis stages of each consultation session
in one go.

[[consult, Start consultation]]
==== Start consultation: `consult`

After a patient is registered, whenever he or she visits your clinic, you can start recording the diagnosis and medicine prescribed by starting a
consultation session on QuickDocs.

Consultation is started after the NRIC of the patient is provided, you can revisit the <<listpat>> section to help identify the NRIC
of specific patients +

- - -

*Format:* `consult r/NRIC` +

*Alias:* `c` +

- - -

*Example:*

* `consult r/S9876542C` +

image::consult_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

Once you started a consultation session for the patient, a message will be displayed on the main display area to indicate that the consultation session
have started for the current patient.

A text indicating that the consultation session have started for the particular patient will also
appear at the bottom right corner of QuickDocs, so that you will be aware that a current consultation session is ongoing even after
subsequent commands.

{nbsp} +

[[diagnose, Diagnose patient]]
==== Diagnosing a patient: `diagnose`

After the consultation session has began, you can start recording the patient's ailments. The various symptoms the patients have can be recorded down,
along with the final assessment of the illness the patient is currently having.

To complete the diagnosis, the record must have one assessment and at least one symptom.

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

- - -

*Format:* `diagnose s/SYMPTOM [s/SYMPTOM] ... a/ASSESSMENT` +

*Alias:* `d` +

- - -

*Example:*

* `diagnose s/runny nose s/sore throat s/phlegmy cough a/influenza` +

image::diagnose_before.png[width="600" align="center"]

The order of symptoms and assessment does not matter here. You record as many symptoms per diagnosis.

- - -

*Results:*

image::diagnose_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

After entering the command, the display will show the symptoms and assessment recorded.

image::diagnose_edit_after.png[width="600" align="center"]

If you made a mistake when entering the diagnosis, you can always rectify it by re-entering the `diagnose` command with the correct
symptoms and assessment. This will replace the current erroneous diagnosis with the one you have just entered.

[TIP]
Whenever you make a mistake entering a command, you can always press the UP and DOWN buttons on your keyboard to cycle through the past
commands you have entered into QuickDocs. This allow you to easily navigate to the erroneous command you have entered, make changes and then reenter
the command again to rectify your errors.

{nbsp} +

[[prescribe, Prescribe medicine]]
==== Prescribing a patient: `prescribe` or `p`

After you are done recording the symptoms and assessing the illness of the patient, you can start prescribing medicine to your patient.

For each medicine prescribed, the quantity must be specified. Like the <<diagnose>> command, you can always reenter the command to override
the current prescription should there be any errors made.

A minimum of one medicine and one quantity is required to record a prescription entry. The order of quantity entered corresponds to the order of the medicine entered. +

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

- - -

*Format:* +
`prescribe m/MEDICINE [m/MEDICINE] ... q/QUANTITY [q/QUANTITY]` +

or

`prescribe m/MEDICINE q/QUANTITY [m/MEDICINE] [q/QUANTITY] ...` +

*Alias:* `p` +

*Results:*

image::endconsult.png[width="600" align="center"]

Notice that the label for the ongoing consultation session is removed once this command is entered. A message to indicate
the end of the consultation session is also shown on the main display area.

{nbsp} +

[[listconsult, List consultations]]
==== List consultation: `listconsult` or `lc`

Whenever you want to revisit a specific consultation record, you can filter it down by the patient before narrowing it down
to the specific session.

You can use QuickDocs to list out all the past consultation sessions of a single patient by first specifying his or her NRIC,
and then view the consultation details by passing in the session's index. +

- - -

*Format:* +
`listconsult INDEX` +

or +

`listconsult r/NRIC` +
